# Taskify

Taskify is a simple yet powerful task management web application built using pure JavaScript and DOM manipulation. It allows users to create, organize, and manage their to-dos across different sections using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

## Features
- **Create Tasks:** Users can add tasks in different sections.
- **Drag and Drop:** Seamlessly move tasks between sections as per their need.
- **Dynamic UI:** Fully interactive interface with real-time task updates.
- **Persistent State:** Tasks remain in their assigned sections during the session.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript** (Vanilla JS for logic and interactivity)
- **HTML & CSS** (For structuring and styling)
- **DOM Manipulation** (Handling task creation, deletion, and movement dynamically)
